    <h3> 
        <p>
            Our location on Rainbow Drive in Michigan is our flagship location.
            We opened our first restaurant in 2011 when our parents retired. After retirement
            our father was curious to see if others would enjoy his food as much as his family 
            and friends. So H-Thai-ML was created for all those that love Thai food and for those
            that want to try something they have never had before. Our father's love for food 
            has brought us into a future that we never thought was possible. Enjoy the wonders 
            of the world of Thai food.  
        </p>
